-How to Install-


First off, these instructions are for using Python 3.10.12. Pytorch has some compatibility issues with more recent versions of python so using this version is ideal.

We initialized a virtual environment using Anaconda with the command

conda create --name smbrl python=3.10.12
conda activate smbrl


Then installed PyTorch v2.1.1

If you are using a GPU, it also depends on what version of CUDA you're using (assuming you're using an NVIDIA card). We are using CUDA 12.1.

Our command looked like (this is for a NVIDA GTX 1060):

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

(Commands for other Cuda versions can be found at https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)


Finally, install the rest of the libraries located in the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

-How to Execute-
Navigate to the folder of the main.py file in command prompt
activate your environment
execute the main.py file

the first time the program is ran a model folder will be created and inside this folder is where you can put a model to be loaded into the system.

To load a model create a folder in the models folder and place your file inside it
then navigate to the desired execution method to either train or to not train
input the name of the folder in the folder_name variable and the name of the file in the ckpt_name variable

A new folder will be created with the current date and time within the models folder when the program is executed and all models saved from training will be stored there
